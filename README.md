This is the front end code for sushi management project.

I tried to deploy the code to Azure, but I failed as the size of package is significantly larger than recommend, I think this is a normal issue when deploying create-react-app code into Azure, I don't know how to solve the problem, I tried webpack config, failed, maybe I need to ask professionals to solve it.

commands:

yarn install: to install dependencies
yarn start: to run it locally
